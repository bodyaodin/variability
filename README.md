# Checking variability as covariance, contravariance and invariance.
Classes for checking variability - Device, Mouse, WiredMouse and WirelessMouse.
<br>Mouse extends Device, WiredMouse and WirelessMouse extends Mouse.</br>

<br>Methods for checking:</br>
* Covariance - deviceManager.useDevices();
* Contravariance - deviceManager.checkForBrokenMouse();
* Invariance - checkDeviceName;
